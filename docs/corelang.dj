# Core language

The jq language is a lazy, functional streaming programming language
originally designed by Stephen Dolan.
The jq language is Turing-complete and can therefore be used to write
any program that can be written in any other programming language.
jq programs can be executed with several interpreters, including
`jq`, `gojq`, `fq`, and `jaq`.

A program written in the jq language is called a jq program or _filter_.
A filter is a function that
takes an input value and
yields a stream of output values.

The stream of output values can be infinite; for example, the jq filter
`repeat("Hi")` yields an infinite sequence of strings `"Hi"`.

The following sections document all filters with built-in syntax in jq.
Examples are written like `1 + 2, true or false --> 3 true`, which means that
running `jaq -n '1 + 2, true or false'` yields the outputs `3` and `true`.

An *atomic* filter is a filter that is _not_ a binary operator.
For example, the filters
`-1`, `map(.+1)`, and `.[0]` are all atomic, whereas the filters
`1 + 2`, `explode | .[]`, and `.[0] += 1` are all non-atomic.
To turn a non-atomic filter `f` into an equivalent atomic filter,
surround it with parentheses, i.e. `(f)`.


## Values

This section lists all potential values that jq filters can process,
and how to produce them.

::: Compatibility

jaq extends the set of values that jq can process by
[byte strings](#byte-strings) and
[objects with non-string values](#objects).
Where
 jq reads and writes values by default as [JSON](#json),
jaq reads and writes values by default as [XJON](#xjon),
which is an extension of JSON.
See those sections for how jaq serialises values.

:::

### `null`

The filter `null` returns the `null` value.

The `null` value can be also obtained in various other ways,
such as indexing a non-existing key in an array or object, e.g.
`[] | .[0] --> null` or
`{} | .a   --> null`.

### Booleans

The filters `true` and `false` return the boolean values `true` and `false`.
Booleans can also be produced by comparison operations, e.g.
`0  ==  0 --> true` or
`[] == {} --> false`.

Every jq value can be mapped to a *boolean value*, namely
`null` and `false` have the boolean value `false`,
all other values have the boolean value `true`.
This is important for filters such as
[`if-then-else`](#if-then-else) and
[`//`](#alternation).

::: Advanced
You can get the boolean value of a value by `not | not`; i.e.
`"" | not | not --> true`.
:::


### Numbers

Numbers are filters that return their corresponding value, e.g.
`0 --> 0`,
`3.14 --> 3.14`, and
`2.99e6 --> 2.99e6`.
Negative numbers can be constructed by
applying the [negation](#negation) operator to a number, e.g. `-1 --> -1`.

Internally, jaq distinguishes
integers, floating-point numbers (floats), and decimal numbers:

- A number without a dot (`.`) and without an exponent (`e`/`E`)
  is losslessly stored as integer.
  jaq can store and calculate with integers of arbitrary size, e.g.
  `340282366920938463463374607431768211456` (`2^128`).
- Any non-integer number is stored initially as decimal number,
  which is a string representation of the number.
  That means that jaq losslessly preserves
  any number corresponding to the regular expression above,
  such as `1.0e500`, if it occurs in a JSON file or jq filter.
- When calculating with a decimal number,
  jaq converts it transparently to a 64-bit
  [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating-point number.
  For example, `1.0e500 + 1 --> Infinity`, because jaq converts
  `1.0e500` to the closest floating-point number, which is `Infinity`.

The rules of jaq are:

* The sum, difference, product, and remainder of two integers is integer, e.g.
  `1 + 2 --> 3`.
* Any other operation between two numbers yields a float, e.g.
  `10 / 2 --> 5.0` and
  `1.0 + 2 --> 3.0`.

You can convert an integer to a floating-point number e.g.
by adding 0.0, by multiplying with 1.0, or by dividing with 1.
You can convert a floating-point number to an integer by
`round`, `floor`, or `ceil`, e.g.
`1.2 | floor, round, ceil --> 1 1 2`.

::: Compatibility
`jq` uses floats for any number,
meaning that it does not distinguish integers from floats.
Many operations in jaq, such as array indexing,
check whether the passed numbers are indeed integer.
The motivation behind this is to avoid
rounding errors that may silently lead to wrong results.
For example,
`[0, 1, 2] | .[1] --> 1`, whereas
`[0, 1, 2] | .[1.0000000000000001]` yields
an error in jaq as opposed to `1` in `jq`.

Furthermore, `jq` prints NaN as `null`; e.g. `nan | tojson` yields `null`.
In contrast, jaq prints NaN as `NaN`; e.g. `nan | tojson --> "NaN"`.
See the [XJON](#xjon) section for details.
:::

::: Advanced
A number corresponds to the regular expression
`[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?([eE][+-]?[0-9]+)?`.
:::

### Text strings

A text string is an array of bytes that can be constructed using the syntax `"..."`.
Here, `...` may contain any UTF-8 characters
in the range from `U+0020` to `U+10FFFF`, excluding `'"'` and `'\'`.
For example,
`"Hello 東京!" --> "Hello 東京!"`.

Furthermore, `...` may contain the following escape sequences:

- `\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, or `\t`
- `\"` or `\\`
- `\uHHHH`, where `HHHH` is a hexadecimal number
- `\(f)`, where `f` is a jq filter (*string interpolation*)

Most characters below `U+0020` can only be produced via a Unicode escape sequence, i.e.
`"NUL = \u0000" --> "NUL = \u0000"`.

A string containing an interpolated filter, such as
`"...\(f)..."`, is equivalent to
`"..." + (f | tostring) + "..."`.
For example:

- `"Hello \("Alice", "Bob") 😀!\n" -->
  "Hello Alice 😀!\n" "Hello Bob 😀!\n"`
- `41 | "The successor of \(.) is \(.+1)." --> "The successor of 41 is 42."`.

A string is *identifier-like* if it matches the regular expression
`[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*`.

Strings may be prefixed with `@x`, where `x` is an identifier; e.g. `@uri`.
In such a case, the filters of interpolated strings are
piped through `@x` instead of `tostring`, i.e.
`@x "...\(f)..."` is equivalent to
`@x "..." + (f | @x) + @x "..."`.
When `"..."` does not contain any interpolated filter, then
`@x "..."` is equivalent to `"..."`.
For example,
`"-[]?" | @uri "https://gedenkt.at/jaq/?q=\(.)" -->
"https://gedenkt.at/jaq/?q=-%5B%5D%3F"`.

### Byte strings

A byte string is an array of bytes that is *not* interpreted as (UTF-8) text.
It can be produced from a text string via the filter [`tobytes`](#tobytes), e.g.
`"Hello, world! 🙂" | tobytes --> b"Hello, world! \xf0\x9f\x99\x82"`.
Currently, there is no native syntax in jaq to produce a byte string directly.

Byte strings differ from text strings in a few regards; in particular,
they can be [indexed](#indexing) and [sliced](#slicing) in constant time.
That makes byte strings interesting e.g. for parsing binary formats.

For compatibility reasons, jaq considers
both text strings and byte strings as strings.
That means that `"Hello" | isstring and (tobytes | isstring) --> true`.
Furthermore, a text string and a byte string that
contain equivalent bytes are considered equal, e.g.
`"Hello" | . == tobytes --> true`.

::: Compatibility
Byte strings do not exist in `jq`; however, they exist in `fq`.
:::

::: Advanced
To find out whether a value is a byte string, we can use:

```
def isbytes: isstring and try (.[0] | true) catch false;
"Hello" | ., tobytes | isbytes --> false true
```

This works because we can index byte strings, but not text strings.
:::

### Arrays

An array is a finite sequence of values.

An empty array can be constructed with the filter
`[]`, which is a short form for
`[empty] --> []`.
An array of values can be constructed using the syntax
`[f]`, where `f` is a filter.
The filter `[f]` passes its input to `f` and runs it,
returning an array containing all outputs of `f`.
If `f` throws an error, then `[f]` returns that error instead of an array.

This syntax allows constructing arrays such as `[1, 2, 3] --> [1, 2, 3]`.
Here, `1, 2, 3` is just a filter that yields three numbers,
see [concatenation](#concatenation).
There is no dedicated array syntax `[x1, ..., xn]`.
That means that you can use arbitrary filters in `[f]`; for example,
`[limit(3; repeat(0))] --> [0, 0, 0]`.
You can use the input passed to `[f]` inside `f`;
for example, we can write the previous filter equivalently as
`{count: 3, elem: 0} | [limit(.count; repeat(.elem))] --> [0, 0, 0]`.

### Objects

An object is a mapping from keys to values.

An empty object can be constructed with the filter `{}`.
An object with a single key and value can be constructed by `{(k): v}`,
where `k` and `v` are both filters.
For example, `{("a"): 1} --> {"a": 1}`.

If `k` is a [string](#text-strings) such as `"a"` or a variable such as `$k`,
then you can omit the parentheses, e.g. `{"a": 1}` or `{$k: 1}`.
If the string is identifier-like,
then you can also omit the quotes, e.g. `{a: 1}`.

To construct an object with multiple key-value pairs,
you can add multiple objects; e.g.
`{(k1): v1} + ... + {(kn): vn}`.
You can write this more compactly as
`{(k1): v1, ..., (kn): vn}`.
For example,
`{a: 1, b: 2} --> {"a": 1, "b": 2}`.

Instead of `{k: .k}` (see [indexing](#indexing)),
you can also write `{k}`; e.g.,
`{a: 1, b: 2} | {a} --> {"a": 1}`.
Instead of `{k: $k}`,
you can also write `{$k}`; e.g.,
`1 as $k | {$k} --> {"k": 1}`.

The filter `{(k): v}` is equivalent to `k as $k | v as $v | {$k: $v}`.
That means that when either `k` or `v` yield multiple output values,
an object is produced for every output combination; for example,
`{("a", "b"): (1, 2)} --> {"a": 1} {"a": 2} {"b": 1} {"b": 2}`.
Note that here, it is necessary to surround `1, 2` with parentheses,
in order to clarify that `,` does not start a new key-value pair.

::: Compatibility
In jq, keys must be strings, whereas
in jaq, keys can be arbitrary values.
Because object keys can be arbitrary values in jaq, you can write e.g.:

```
{(0): 1, "2": 3, ([4]): 5, ({}): 6} -->
{ 0 : 1, "2": 3,  [4] : 5,  {} : 6}
```

Note that in a jq filter, non-string keys must be surrounded with parentheses,
whereas in XJON, parentheses must not be used.

This yields an error in `jq`.
:::


## Path operators

jq's path operators retrieve parts of their input.

{#indexing}
### Indexing (`.[x]`)

The indexing operator `.[x]` yields the `x`-th element of the input.
For example:

- `[1, 2, 3] | .[1] --> 2`
- `{a: 1, b: 2} | .["a"] --> 1`

If there is no element at that index in the input, then this operator returns `null`.
For example:

- `[1, 2, 3] | .[3] --> null`
- `{a: 1, b: 2} | .["c"] --> null`

This operator treats byte string input like an array of numbers in the range 0..256.
For example,
`"@ABC" | tobytes | .[0] --> 64`,
because the character `'@'` is encoded in UTF-8 as single byte `64` (`0x40`).

This operator yields an error either
if the input is neither an array or an object, or
if the input is an array and the index is not an integer.

For identifier-like strings like `name`,
you can write `.name` as short form for `.["name"]`.
For example,
`{a: 1} | .a --> 1`.
This works also for strings that are the same as reserved [keywords](#keywords); e.g.
`{if: 1} | .if --> 1`.

For array input, you can also use negative numbers as index,
which will be interpreted as index counting from the end of the array.
For example,
`[1, 2, 3] | .[-1] --> 3`.

::: Compatibility

`jq` accepts floating-point numbers as array indices; e.g.
`[1, 2] | .[1.5]` yields `2`.
In jaq, indexing an array with a floating-point number yields an error.
The same applies to the [slicing](#slicing) operator below.

:::

{#slicing}
### Slicing (`.[x:y]`)

The slicing operator `.[x:y]` yields a slice of a string or an array,
from the `x`-th element to (excluding) the `y`-th element.
For example,
`[1, 2, 3] | .[1:3] --> [2, 3]`, and
`"Hello World!" | .[6:11] --> "World"`.

When slicing a text string, the `x`-th element refers to the `x`-th *UTF-8 character*.
For example,
`"老虎" | .[1:2] --> "虎"`.
On the other hand, when slicing a byte string, the `x`-th element refers to the `x`-th *byte*.
For example,
`"Färber" | tobytes, . | .[2:] | [., length] --> [b"\xa4rber", 5] ["rber", 4]`,
because the letter 'ä' takes two bytes, but only one character.

Like the indexing operator, the slicing operator
treats byte string input like an array of numbers and
interprets negative indices as indices counting from the end.

The short form `.[x:]` creates a slice from the index `x` to the end, and
the short form `.[:y]` creates a slice from the beginning to (excluding) the index `x`.
For example, `"Hello World!" | .[:5], .[6:] --> "Hello" "World!"`.

{#iterating}
### Iterating (`.[]`)

The iteration operator `.[]` yields all values `v1 ... vn` when given
an array `[v1, ..., vn]` or
an object `{k1: v1, ..., kn: vn}`.
For example,
`[1, 2, 3] | .[] --> 1 2 3` and
`{a: 1, b: 2} | .[] --> 1 2`.

::: Advanced

It holds that `.[]` has the same effect as `.[keys[]]`.
For example,
`[1, 2, 3] | .[keys[]] --> 1 2 3`.

:::

### Compound paths

For each of the filters in this section,
you can employ any atomic filter instead of the leading `.` (identity).
For example, you can write `explode[]` as short form for `explode | .[]`.

You can also terminate any filter in this section with a `?`,
which silences errors from that operator.
For example, `.[]` yields an error if the input is neither an array nor an object,
but `.[]?` silences such errors, yielding no output instead.

You can chain together an arbitrary number of these operators;
for example, `.[0][]?[:-1]` is the same as `.[0] | .[]? | .[:-1]`.

::: Advanced

When you combine the techniques above, be aware that
the filters `x` and `y` in `.[x]` and `.[x:y]`
are executed on the *original* input and
are *not* influenced by error suppression with `?`.
That means that `f[][x]?[y:z]` is equivalent to
`f as $f | x as $x | y as $y | z as $z | $f | .[] | .[$x]? | .[$y:$z]`.

:::


## Nullary

A nullary filter does not take any arguments.

{#identity}
### Identity (`.`)

The filter `.` yields its input as single output.
For example,
`1 | . --> 1`.

{#recursion}
### Recursion (`..`)

The filter `..` yields its input and all recursively contained values.
For example:

```
{"a": 1, "b": [2, ["3"]]} | .. -->
{"a": 1, "b": [2, ["3"]]}
1
[2, ["3"]]
2
["3"]
"3"
```

## Unary

A unary filter takes a single argument.

{#negation}
### Negation (`-`)

The prefix operator `-f` runs the atomic filter `f` and negates its outputs.
For example,
`-1 --> -1` and
`-(1, 2) --> -1 -2`.

{#error-suppression}
### Error suppression (`?`)

The postfix operator `f?` runs the atomic filter `f` and
returns all its outputs until (excluding) the first error.
For example,
`(1, error, 2)? --> 1`.

This operator is equivalent to `try f` (see [`try-catch`](#try-catch)).
For example,
`try (1, error, 2) --> 1`.

::: Advanced

We can see that error suppression has a higher precedence than negation by
`try -[]? catch -1 --> -1`, which shows us that
`-[]?` yields the same as `-([]?)`, which is equivalent to
`-[]` and yields an error.
If negation would have a higher precedence,
then `-[]?` would be equivalent to `(-[])?`;
however, that filter yields no output, as we can see by
`(-[])? --> `.

:::



## Binary (complex)

A binary filter takes two arguments.

All binary operators that contain the characters `|` or `=` are right-associative.
All other binary operators are left-associative.
That means that for example,
`f | g | h` is equivalent to `f | (g | h)`, whereas
`f - g - h` is equivalent to `(f - g) - h`.

This section lists all binary infix filters sorted by increasing precedence.

{#composition}
### Composition (`|`)

The filter `f | g` runs `f`, and
for every output `y` of `f`, it runs `g` with `y` as input and yields its outputs.
For example, `(1, 2) | (., 3) --> 1 3 2 3`.

If either `f` or `g` yields an error, then
`f | g` yields that error, followed by nothing.
For example, `(1, 2) | (., error)` yields the same as `1, error`.

{#variable-binding}
### Variable binding (`as $x |`)

The filter `f as $x | g` runs `f`, and
for every output `x` of `f`, it binds the value of `x` to the *variable* `$x`.
Here, `x` is an identifier.
It then runs `g` *on the original input*,
replacing any reference to `$x` in `g` by the value `x`.
For example,
`"Hello" | length as $x | . + " has length \($x)" --> "Hello has length 5"`.

Variables can be shadowed, such as
`0 as $x | (1 as $x | $x), $x --> 1 0`.

{#concatenation}
### Concatenation (`,`)

The filter `f, g` yields the concatenation of the outputs of `f` and `g`.
For example, `1, 2 --> 1 2`.

{#plain-assignment}
### Plain assignment (`=`)

The filter `f = g` runs `g` with its input, and
for every output `y` of `g`, it
returns a copy of the input whose
values at the positions given by `f` are replaced by `y`.
For example:

```
[1, 2, 3] | .[0] = (length, 4) -->
[3, 2, 3]
[4, 2, 3]
```

{#update-assignment}
### Update assignment (`|=`)

The filter `f |= g` returns a copy of its input where
each value `v` at a position given by `f` is replaced by
the output of `g` run with input `v`.
For example,
`[1, 2, 3] | .[] |= .*2 --> [2, 4, 6]`.

When `g` yields *no* outputs, then the value at the position is deleted;
for example,
`[1, 2, 3] | .[0] |= empty --> [2, 3]` and
`{a: 1, b: 2} | .a |= empty --> {"b": 2}`.

::: Advanced

When `g` yields *multiple* outputs, then it depends on
the input type and on `f` whether more than one output of `g` is considered.
For example, the following updates consider multiple outputs:

- `1 | . |= (., .*2) --> 1 2`
- `[1, 2, 3] |  .[ ] |= (., .*2) --> [1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6]`

On the other hand, the following updates consider only the first output:

- `[1, 2, 3] |  .[0] |= (., .*2) --> [1, 2, 3]`
- `{a: 1, b: 2} | .a |= (., .*2) --> {"a": 1, "b": 2}`

:::

{#arithmetic-update-assignment}
### Arithmetic update assignment (`+=`, `-=`, ...)

The filters
`f += g`,
`f -= g`,
`f *= g`,
`f /= g`,
`f %= g`, and
`f //= g`
are short-hand forms for
`f = . + g`, ...
For example:

```
[1, 2, 3] | .[0] += (length, 4) -->
[4, 2, 3]
[5, 2, 3]
```

{#alternation}
### Alternation (`//`)

The filter `f // g` runs `f` and yields
all its outputs whose [boolean value](#booleans) is `true`; that is,
all outputs that are neither `null` nor `false`.
If `f` yields no such outputs, then this filter yields the outputs of `g`.
For example:

- `(null, 1, false, 2) // (3, 4) --> 1 2`
- `(null, false) // (3, 4) --> 3 4`
- `empty // 3 --> 3`

{#logic}
### Logic (`or`, `and`)

The filter `f or g` (disjunction) evaluates `f` and
returns `true` if its boolean value is `true`, else it
returns the boolean values of `g`.
The filter `f and g` (conjunction) evaluates `f` and
returns `false` if its boolean value is `false`, else it
returns the boolean values of `g`.

For example:

```
(true, false) or (true, false) -->
true
true
false
```

```
(true, false) and (true, false) -->
true
false
false
```

The filter `f and g` has higher precedence than `f or g`.

::: Advanced

We can see the higher precedence of `and` by
`false and true or true --> true`, which yields the same as
`(false and true) or true --> true`, but not the same as
`false and (true or true) --> false`.

To find this formula, I used the following program:

```
def bool: true, false;
{x: bool, y: bool, z: bool} | select(
  ((.x and  .y) or .z ) !=
  ( .x and (.y  or .z))
) -->
{
  "x": false,
  "y": true,
  "z": true
}
{
  "x": false,
  "y": false,
  "z": true
}
```

:::

It holds that `f or g` is equivalent to `f as $x | $x or g`;
similar for `and`.


## Binary (simple)

Every simple binary operator such as `+` in this section fulfills the property that
`f + g` is equivalent to
`f as $x | g as $y | $x + $y`.
For example,
`(1, 2) + (1, 3) --> 2 4 3 5` and
`(1, 2) * (1, 3) --> 1 3 2 6`.
This property does not hold for the complex binary filters above.

::: Compatibility
In `jq`, a slightly different property holds, namely that
`f + g` is equivalent to
`g as $y | f as $x | $x + $y`.
That means that in `jq`,
`(1, 2) + (1, 3)` yields `2 3 4 5`.

As a result, in jaq,
`(1,2) * (3,4) --> 3 4 6 8` and
`{a: (1,2), b: (3,4)} | .a * .b --> 3 4 6 8`
yield the same outputs, whereas `jq` yields `3 6 4 8` for the former example.
:::

{#equality}
### Equality (`==`, `!=`)

The operator `$x == $y` returns `true` if the two values `$x` and `$y` are equal, else `false`.
Similarly, `$x != $y` returns the negation of `$x == $y`, i.e. `$x == $y | not`.

Interesting cases include:

- NaN does not equal any value, including itself; i.e.
  `nan == nan --> false`
- An integer `i` equals a float `f` if
  `f` is finite and `i` converted to a float is equal to `f`; i.e.
  `1 == 1.0 --> true`.
- Arrays are equal if they have the same values; i.e.
  `[1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]`, but
  `[3, 2, 1] != [1, 2, 3]`.
- Objects are equal if they have the same keys and for every key,
  the associated value is equal; i.e.
  `{a: 1, b: 2} == {b: 2, a: 1} --> true`

::: Advanced

There are values that are equal,
yet yield different results when fed to the same filter.
For example:

```
{a: 1, b: 2} as $x |
{b: 2, a: 1} as $y |
$x == $y, ($x | tojson) == ($y | tojson) -->
true false
```

:::

{#ordering}
### Ordering (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)

The operator `$x < $y` returns `true` if `$x` is smaller than `$y`.
Similarly:

- `$x >  $y` is equivalent to `$y < $x`,
- `$x <= $y` is equivalent to `$x < $y or $x == $y`, and
- `$x >= $y` is equivalent to `$x > $y or $x == $y`.

Values are ordered as follows:

- `null`
- Booleans: `false < true --> true`
- Numbers:

    - `NaN` is smaller than any other number, including itself; i.e.
      `nan < nan --> true`
    - `-Infinity`, e.g. `-infinite < -99999999999999999999999999 --> true`
    - Finite numbers, e.g. `0 < 1 --> true`
    - `Infinity`, e.g. `infinite > 99999999999999999999999999 --> true`
- Strings: lexicographic ordering by underlying bytes, e.g.
  `"Hello" < "Hello World" --> true` and
  `"@B" < "A" --> true`.
- Arrays: lexicographic ordering, e.g.
  `[1, 2] < [1, 2, 3] --> true` and
  `[0, 2] < [1] --> true`.
- Objects: An object `$x` is smaller than an object `$y` either if:

  - the keys of `$x` are smaller than the keys of `$y` or
  - the keys of `$x` are equal to the keys of `$y` and
    the values of `$x` are smaller than the values of `$y`.

::: Advanced
More precisely, an object `$x` is smaller than an object `$y` if:

```
($x | to_entries | sort_by(.key)) as $ex |
($y | to_entries | sort_by(.key)) as $ey |
[$ex[].key]   < [$ey[].key] or
[$ex[].key]  == [$ey[].key] and
[$ex[].value] < [$ey[].value]
```

{#add-sub}
### Addition / subtraction (`+`, `-`)

The filter `$x + $y` adds two values as follows:

- `null + $x` and `$x + null` yields `$x`.
- Adding numbers yields their sum, which is
  integer if both numbers are integer, else a floating-point number.
  For example,
  `1 + 2 --> 3` and
  `1 + 2.0 --> 3.0`.
- Adding strings or arrays concatenates them, i.e.
  `"Hello, " + "World!" --> "Hello, World!"` and
  `[1, 2] + [3, 4] --> [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Adding objects yields their *union*.
  If a key is present in both objects, then the resulting object
  will contain the key with the value of the object on the *right*; i.e.
  `{a: 1, b: 2} + {b: 3, c: 4} --> {"a": 1, "b": 3, "c": 4}`.
- Adding anything else yields an error.

The filter `$x - $y` subtracts `$y` from `$x` as follows:

- Subtracting numbers yields their difference, similar to addition.
- Subtracting arrays yields the
  left array with all elements contained in the right array removed; i.e.
  `[1, 2, 3, 4] - [2, 4] --> [1, 3]`.
- Subtracting anything else yields an error.

{#mul-div}
### Multiplication / division (`*`, `/`)

The filter `$x * $y` multiplies two values as follows:

- Multiplying numbers yields their product, similar to addition.
- Multiplying a string with an integer `$n` yields
  the `$n`-fold concatenation of the string, i.e.
  `"abc" * 3 --> "abcabcabc"`.
  If `$n <= 0`, then this yields `null`, i.e.
  `0 * "abc" --> null`.
- Multiplying two objects merges them recursively.
  In particular,
  `$x * {k: v, ...}` yields
  `($x + {k: $x[k] * v}) * {...}` if both `v` and `$x[k]` are objects, else
  `($x + {k: v}) * {...}`.
  For example,
  `{a: {b: 0, c: 2}, e: 4} * {a: {b: 1, d: 3}, f: 5} -->
  {"a": {"b": 1, "c": 2, "d": 3}, "e": 4, "f": 5}`.
- Multiplying anything else yields an error.

The filter `$x / $y` divides two values as follows:

- Dividing a number by a number yields their quotient as floating-point number.
  To perform this operation, both arguments are first converted to floating-point numbers.
  For example, `1 / 2 --> 0.5`.
- Dividing a string by a string *splits* `$x` by `$y`, yielding an array of strings.
  For example,
  `"foobarfoobazfoo" / "foo" --> ["", "bar", "baz", ""]`.
  If `$y` is empty, then `$x / $y` yields an array with each character of the input as separate string.
  For example,
  `"🧑‍🔬 is 🤔" / "" --> ["🧑","‍","🔬"," ","i","s"," ","🤔"]`.

::: Advanced

You can round-trip string division with `join($y)`.
For example:

- `"foobarfoobazfoo" / "foo" | join("foo") --> "foobarfoobazfoo"`
- `"🧑‍🔬 is 🤔" / "" | join("") --> "🧑‍🔬 is 🤔"`

:::

::: Compatibility
In jq, division by 0 yields an error, whereas
in jaq, `n / 0` yields
`nan` if `n == 0`,
` infinite` if `n > 0`, and
`-infinite` if `n < 0`.
jaq's behaviour is closer to the IEEE standard for floating-point arithmetic (IEEE 754).
:::

{#mod}
### Modulus (`%`)

The filter `$x % $y` calculates the modulus of two numbers,
and fails for anything else.
For example,
`5 % 2 --> 1`.
Any of the two numbers can also be a floating-point number;
however, the result of this may be unexpected.
For example,
`5.1 % 2 --> 1.0999999999999996` and
`5.5 % 2 --> 1.5`.



## Keywords

This section lists all filters that start with a reserved keyword.

### if-then-else

The filter `if p then f else g end` runs the filter `p` with its input.
For every output of `p`, if its [boolean value](#booleans) is `true`,
the outputs of `f` run with the original input are returned, else
the outputs of `g` run with the original input are returned.

Examples:

- `if true     then 0 else 1 end --> 0`
- `if [], null then 0 else 1 end --> 0 1`

There exists a longer form of this filter, namely
`if p1 then f1 elif p2 then f2 ... else g end`.
This is equivalent to
`if p1 then f1 else (if p2 then f2 else (... else g end) end) end`.

When the `else g` part is omitted, it is equivalent to `else .`; for example,
`0 | if false then .+1 end --> 0`.

### try-catch

The filter `try f catch g` runs the atomic filter `f` with its input,
and returns its outputs until (excluding) the first error.
If `f` yields an error, then
the atomic filter `g` is run with the error value as input,
and its outputs are returned.

Examples:

- `try (1, error(42), 2) catch (. + 1) --> 1 43`
- `try (1,            2) catch (. + 1) --> 1 2`

A short form of this filter is
`try f`, which is equivalent to
`try f catch empty` as well as to
`f?` ([error suppression](#error-suppression)).

### label-break

The filter `label $x | f` binds the label `$x` in `f`,
runs `f` and yields its outputs.
If the evaluation of `f` calls `break $x`,
then the evaluation of `label $x | f` is stopped and returns no more outputs.
For example,
`label $x | 1, break $x, 2 --> 1`.

Labels are distinct from variables, which means that
`0 as $x | label $x | $x, break $x --> 0`.

Like variables, labels can be shadowed; e.g.
`label $x | 1, (label $x | 2, break $x, 3), 4, break $x, 5 --> 1 2 4`.

It is possible to `break` from a filter argument; e.g.
`def f(g): 1, g, 2; label $x | f(break $x) --> 1`.

### reduce / foreach

The filters
`reduce xs as $x (init; update)` and
`foreach xs as $x (init; update; project)`
both run the atomic filter `xs` on its input.
Suppose that the outputs of `xs` are `x1`, ..., `xn`.
Then the filters are equivalent to:

```
reduce x1, ..., xn as $x (init; update) :=
init
| x1 as $x | update
| ...
| xn as $x | update
```

```
foreach x1, ..., xn as $x (init; update; project) :=
init |
( x1 as $x | update | project,
( ...
( xn as $x | update | project,
( empty ))...))
```

Here, both `update` and `project` have access to the current `$x`.

The filter
`foreach xs as $x (init; update)` is equivalent to
`foreach xs as $x (init; update; .)`.

As example, we can calculate the sum and the cumulative sum using
`reduce` and `foreach`, respectively:

- `reduce  (1, 2, 3) as $x (0; . + $x) --> 6`
- `foreach (1, 2, 3) as $x (0; . + $x) --> 1 3 6`
- `foreach (1, 2, 3) as $x (0; . + $x; [$x, .]) --> [1, 1] [2, 3] [3, 6]`

Let us expand the first and the last example using the equivalences above
to see what is calculated:

```
# reduce  (1, 2, 3) as $x (0; . + $x)
0
| 1 as $x | . + $x  # 1
| 2 as $x | . + $x  # 3
| 3 as $x | . + $x  # 6
--> 6
```

```
# foreach (1, 2, 3) as $x (0; . + $x; [$x, .])
0 |
( 1 as $x | . + $x | [$x, .],  # [1, 1]
( 2 as $x | . + $x | [$x, .],  # [2, 3]
( 3 as $x | . + $x | [$x, .],  # [3, 6]
( empty ))))
--> [1, 1] [2, 3] [3, 6]
```

We can also reverse a list via
`[1, 2, 3] | reduce .[] as $x ([]; [$x] + .) --> [3, 2, 1]`.
(However, note that this has quadratic runtime and is thus quite inefficient.)

Note that when `xs` yields no outputs, then
`reduce`  yields `init`, whereas
`foreach` yields no output.
For example:

- `reduce  empty as $x (0; . + $x) --> 0` and
- `foreach empty as $x (0; . + $x) -->` (no output).

::: Compatibility
The execution of `reduce` and `foreach` differs between `jq` and jaq
when `update` yields multiple outputs.
However, the precise behaviour of `jq` in that case
is quite difficult to describe.

The interpretation of `reduce`/`foreach` in jaq has the following advantages over jq:

* It deals very naturally with filters that yield multiple outputs.
  In contrast, jq discriminates outputs of `f`,
  because it recurses only on the last of them,
  although it outputs all of them.
* It makes the implementation of `reduce` and `foreach`
  special cases of the same code, reducing the potential for bugs.
:::

::: Advanced
Consider the following example for an `update` yielding multiple values:
`foreach (5, 10) as $x (1; .+$x, -.) -->
6 16 -6 -1 9 1` in jaq, whereas it yields
`6 -1 9 1` in jq.
We can see that both jq and jaq yield the values
resulting from the first iteration (where `$x` is 5), namely
`1 | 5 as $x | (.+$x, -.) --> 6 -1`.
However, jq performs the second iteration (where `$x` is 10)
*only on the last value* returned from the first iteration, namely `-1`,
yielding the values
`-1 | 10 as $x | (.+$x, -.) --> 9 1`.
jaq yields these values too, but it also performs the second iteration
on all other values returned from the first iteration, namely `6`,
yielding the values
` 6 | 10 as $x | (.+$x, -.) --> 16 -6`.
:::


### def

The filter `def x: f; g` binds the filter `f` to a filter with the name `x`.
Here, `x` is an identifier.
The filter `g` can contain calls to the filter `x`, and
any such calls will be replaced by the filter `f`.

For example, we can define a filter `iter` by
`def iter: .[];` and use it subsequently by
`def iter: .[]; [1, 2, 3] | iter --> 1 2 3`.
This is equivalent to writing
`[1, 2, 3] | .[] --> 1 2 3`.

Definitions can be chained and nested. For example:

```
def foo:
  def bar: 1;
  def baz: 2;
  bar + baz;
foo --> 3
```

Here, we chained the definitions of `bar` and `baz`.
These definitions are only visible inside the definition of `foo`;
that means that at the place where we call `foo`,
we can use neither `bar` nor `baz`.

Definitions can be recursive, meaning that they call themselves.
For example,
`def f: 0, f; f` yields an infinite sequence of `0` values.
An example of a non-terminating filter is
`def r: r; r`.
Finally, the following filter yields an infinite
stream of integers starting from its input:

```
def ints_from: ., (. + 1 | ints_from);
1 | limit(3; ints_from) --> 1 2 3
```

Definitions can also take *arguments*:
The filter `def x(x1; ...; xn): f; g` binds the filter `f` to
a filter with the name `x` and the arity `n`.
Here, `x1` to `xn` are identifiers that are the arguments of `x`, and
`f` can contain references to these arguments.
The filter `g` can contain calls of the shape `x(g1; ...; gn)`,
where `g1` to `gn` are filters.
Any such calls will be replaced by the filter `f`, where
every argument `xi` is replaced by its corresponding filter `gi`.

For example, the filter [`map(f)`](#map) in the standard library is defined by
`def map(f): [.[] | f]`.
We can use it via
`[1, 2, 3] | map(   .+1) --> [2, 3, 4]`, which is equivalent to
`[1, 2, 3] | [.[] | .+1] --> [2, 3, 4]`.

We can use variables as arguments of definitions.
For example, we can write
`def singleton($x): [$x]` as short form of
`def singleton(x): x as $x | [$x]`.
Note that this is not the same as
`def singleton(x): [x]`:

- `def singleton($x): [$x]; singleton(1, 2, 3) --> [1] [2] [3]`
- `def singleton( x): [ x]; singleton(1, 2, 3) --> [1,  2,  3]`

Arguments of definitions may capture variables, labels, and other definitions.
For example:

```
def iter_map(f): .[] | f;
def double: .+.;
3 as $threshold  |
label $lbl |
[1, 2, 3] | iter_map(if . < $threshold then double else break $lbl end) -->
 2  4
```

Here, the argument to `iter_map` captures
the definition `double`,
the variable `$threshold`, and
the label `$lbl`.

::: Advanced
We can always transform a
definition with    variable arguments to an equivalent
definition without variable arguments.
For that, suppose that `$x` is the rightmost variable argument in a definition
`def x(...; $x; ...): g`.
We can replace it by
`def x(...;  x; ...): x as $x | g`.

For example, consider the definition
`def f($x1; x2; $x3; x4): g`.
This is equivalent to
`def f(x1; x2; x3; x4): x1 as $x1 | x3 as $x3 | g`.
