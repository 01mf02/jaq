jaq (pronounced /ʒaːk/, like *Jacques*[^jacques]) is a clone of the JSON data processing tool [jq].
jaq aims to support a large subset of jq's syntax and operations.

You can try jaq online on the [jaq playground](https://gedenkt.at/jaq/).
Instructions for the playground can be found [here](jaq-play/).

jaq focuses on three goals:

* **Correctness**:
  jaq aims to provide a more correct and predictable implementation of jq,
  while preserving compatibility with jq in most cases.
* **Performance**:
  I created jaq originally because I was bothered by
  [the long start-up time of jq 1.6](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/issues/1411),
  which amounts to about 50ms on my machine.
  This can be particularly seen when processing a large number of small files.
  Although the startup time has been vastly improved in jq 1.7,
  jaq is still faster than jq on many other [benchmarks](#performance).
* **Simplicity**:
  jaq aims to have a simple and small implementation, in order to
  reduce the potential for bugs and to
  facilitate contributions.

I drew inspiration from another Rust program, namely [jql].
However, unlike jql, jaq aims to closely imitate jq's syntax and semantics.
This should allow users proficient in jq to easily use jaq.

[^jacques]: I wanted to create a tool that should be discreet and obliging, like a good waiter.
  And when I think of a typical name for a (French) waiter, to my mind comes "Jacques".
  Later, I found out about the old French word *jacquet*, meaning "squirrel",
  which makes for a nice *ex post* inspiration for the name.



# Installation


## Binaries

You can download binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows on the [releases page](https://github.com/01mf02/jaq/releases).
On a Linux system, you can download it using the following commands:

    $ curl -fsSL https://github.com/01mf02/jaq/releases/latest/download/jaq-$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl -o jaq && chmod +x jaq

You may also install jaq using [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jaq) on macOS or Linux:

    $ brew install jaq
    $ brew install --HEAD jaq # latest development version

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/jaq.svg)](https://repology.org/project/jaq/versions)


## From Source

To compile jaq, you need a Rust toolchain.
See <https://rustup.rs/> for instructions.

Any of the following commands install jaq:

    $ cargo install --locked jaq
    $ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/01mf02/jaq # latest development version

On my system, both commands place the executable at `~/.cargo/bin/jaq`.

If you have cloned this repository, you can also build jaq by executing one of the commands in the cloned repository:

    $ cargo build --release # places binary into target/release/jaq
    $ cargo install --locked --path jaq # installs binary

jaq should work on any system supported by Rust.
If it does not, please file an issue.



# Performance

The following evaluation consists of several benchmarks that
allow comparing the performance of jaq, jq, and [gojq].
The `empty` benchmark runs `n` times the filter `empty` with null input,
serving to measure the startup time.
The `bf-fib` benchmark runs a Brainfuck interpreter written in jq,
interpreting a Brainfuck script that produces `n` Fibonacci numbers.
The other benchmarks evaluate various filters with `n` as input;
see [`bench.sh`](bench.sh) for details.

I generated the benchmark data with
`bench.sh target/release/jaq jq-1.8.1 gojq-0.12.17 | tee bench.json`
on a Linux system with an AMD Ryzen 5 5500U.[^binaries]
I then processed the results with a "one-liner" (stretching the term and the line a bit):

    jq -rs '.[] | "|`\(.name)`|\(.n)|" + ([.time[] | min | (.*1000|round)? // "N/A"] | min as $total_min | map(if . == $total_min then "**\(.)**" else "\(.)" end) | join("|"))' bench.json

(Of course, you can also use jaq here instead of jq.)
Finally, I concatenated the table header with the output and piped it through `pandoc -t gfm`.

[^binaries]: The binaries for jq-1.8.1 and gojq-0.12.17 were retrieved from their GitHub release pages.

Table: Evaluation results in milliseconds ("N/A" if error or more than 10 seconds).

| `cumsum-xy`     | 1048576 |     400 |  **350** |          680 |

The results show that
jaq-2.3 is fastest on 23 benchmarks, whereas
jq-1.8.1 is fastest on 3 benchmark and
gojq-0.12.17 is fastest on 3 benchmarks.
gojq is much faster on `tree-flatten` because it implements the filter `flatten` natively instead of by definition.

# Security

jaq's core has been audited by
[Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/)
as part of an [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/) grant ---
thanks to both organisations for their support!
The [security audit](https://github.com/01mf02/jaq/releases/download/v2.2.0/jaq.penetration.test.report.2025.1.0.pdf) found
one low severity issue and three issues that are likely not exploitable at all.
As a result of this security audit, all issues were addressed and
several fuzzing targets for jaq were added at `jaq-core/fuzz`.
Before that, jaq's JSON parser [hifijson](https://github.com/01mf02/hifijson/)
already disposed of a fuzzing target.
Finally, jaq disposes of a carefully crafted test suite of more than 500 tests
that is checked at every commit.

jaq has also profited from:

* [serde_json] to read and [colored_json] to output JSON,
* [chumsky] to parse and [ariadne] to pretty-print parse errors,
* [mimalloc] to boost the performance of memory allocation, and
* the Rust standard library, in particular its awesome [Iterator],
  which builds the rock-solid base of jaq's filter execution
